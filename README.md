##IMPORTANT COMMENT: code can be read in jupyter notebooks in this order:
    0.1- PROJECT-II.ipynb
    0.2 -answers_info.ipynb
    0.3 -Q5 ANSWER.ipynb

Unfortunately it is not all in main and src + visualization folders due to errors that I have not been able to solve


## 1. Libraries and Data used:
1.1 Libraries: <br>
    - seaborn <br>
    - matplotlib <br>
    - pandas <br>
    - numpy <br>
    - os <br>
    - b4S <br>
    
2.1 Data source:
    - https://www.metal.com/Rare-Earth-Oxides
    -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/global-rare-earth-elements-projects
    

## 2. Data extracting / Data scrapping: 
2.1. create a df from the information scrapped from www.metal.com to get updated info regardin REO prices <br>
2.2. Consistent naming between both df: <br>
2.3 Export csv for data extraction and visualization

## 3. Data cleaning: 
3.1. Drop empty rows / dupplicate values in needed <br>
3.2. Consistent naming between both df: <br>
3.3. Change value type when needed in order to be able to carry on calculations <br>

## 4. Data Exploration & Visualization
4.1. Create subset filtering the desired data to answer each question <br>
4.2. Create plots in order to visualize each answer (if not done via subset) <br>



## 5. Conclusions
5.1 - the most of the projects are in AUSTRALIA and AMERICA. This is due to the countries, after the pandemic crises
    , realized of its dependency from China in raw materials that have been proved to be strategic.
5.2-The impact of the price of the Reo in the mine has higher impact than the quantity so, South Australia Project,
    despite being the second largest one, is not one of the top 10. 
5.2-The country with the most valuable explotations is China with 2 projects in the TOP 3
